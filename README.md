# myutil
Small Project to write my own Python classes mainly for self-use.

My inital class attempt has all sorts of stuff in it.
Also i never really created a class on my own before, and that's what this mess looks like:
Too much in one class, the code is bad and the usage is a pain.

My first goal is to split off different functions to its own classes and use proper python class synthax.

Second goal (for now) is to convert a local Nagios check for Ceph Mimic, including performance data, from bash to python.
Why? Because i like Python and like to use it an improve. But also because i personally dont like bash.

Updates on further steps will most likely follow.

I will only focus on maintaining the python3 version!
